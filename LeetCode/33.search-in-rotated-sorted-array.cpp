 *
 * There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct
 * values).
 * 
 * Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an
 * unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array
 * is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]
 * (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3
 * and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
 * 
 * Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target,
 * return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: 4
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: -1
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1], target = 0
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 * -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * All values of nums are unique.
 * nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
 * -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
 *
